# MusicalTeleportation
A python model for how to instantly share large amounts of data using very little data.

There are currently experiments going on, in physics, in which one molecular configuration is being taken apart at one site, and duplicated precisely in a second. This is called an early form of teleportation.

With data, similarly, if pre-existing modules of data exist, and a person creates new configurations of this data, then the only thing that needs to be shared is the configuration, not the data itself. The bulk of the data can already exist in the cloud or in users' storage.

This code provides a model. It randomly generates a list, which encues a particular set of .mp3s, these already being stored at the Internet Archive. Using the code generates a very small .m3u, which appears in the user's programs' directory.

The user need only share the .m3u to duplicate the piece, instantly, for anyone. The actual sonic data remains in the cloud and is referenced only by the .m3u.
